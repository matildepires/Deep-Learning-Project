# Deep Learning Project

Grade: 18 out of 20

**Project Description:**
This computer vision project's goal is to detect if someoneâ€™s eyes are open or closed, so as to further detect signs of drowsiness, with the purpose of being applied to medical professionals before a surgery, to deem them fit or not. For this, we developed several models with different levels of complexity, using Convolutional Neural Networks, which were trained with labeled images of people's faces, that we pre-processed. In this project several techniques to improve generalization were performed, such as data augmentation, dropout, callbacks and weight regularization. In the end, a good performance was achieved, with an accuracy score of 97% on the test dataset. With this done we even adapted to our model a system that generates a drowsiness score, based on people's eyes being open/closed on a video.
